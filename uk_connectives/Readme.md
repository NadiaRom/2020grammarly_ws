# Group task: Creating an initial lexicon of Ukranian connectives

1. Determine whether the given candidate word (or phrase) is a connective:

- it is a fixed (closed class) expression that cannot be modified or conjugated
- it semantically relates to arguments
- the arguments are "abstract objects" (propositions, facts, events, ...)
- the arguments are in principle expressible as clauses

2. After determining the connectives (from 1.), group them into semantic classes:

- temporal
- contingency (causal + conditional)
- contrast (contrast and similarity)
- expansion (additive relations)

3. Group connectives by substitution tests: which connectives can replace each other in the examples?

## Data

I've extracted the connective candidates from the bilingual (English-Ukrainian) dictionaries of the QED and OpenSubtitles corpora (see references below). The corpus data is available for **research purposes** only! Please see [OPUS](http://opus.nlpl.eu/index.php) for more information. 

As seeds, I have used the English connectives (heads only) extracted from the PDTB, as distributed in the [Eng-DiMLex lexicon](https://github.com/discourse-lab/en_dimlex/blob/master/en_dimlex.xml). 

Similarly, the corpus samples for each connective candidate have been extracted from the (EN-UK section of the) QED corpus.
