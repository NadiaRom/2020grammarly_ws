# Group task: Creating an initial lexicon of Ukranian connectives

1. Determine whether the given candidate word (or phrase) is a connective:

- it is a fixed (closed class) expression that cannot be modified or conjugated
- it semantically relates to arguments
- the arguments are "abstract objects" (propositions, facts, events, ...)
- the arguments are in principle expressible as clauses

2. After determining the connectives (from 1.), group them into semantic classes:

- temporal
- contingency (causal + conditional)
- contrast (contrast and similarity)
- expansion (additive relations)

3. Group connectives by substitution tests: which connectives can replace each other in the examples?
